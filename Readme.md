Orphan Link Checker
======================
A very simple experiment with [PBWorks' API](http://pbworks.com/api_v2/). This app takes a user key and a workspace url and checks for orphan pages. It is synchronous, so it may choke on very large wikis. I made this primarily as a refresher course in php, and to check out how microframeworks do in that language. It may be a usable base if you want to make an app that does some other simple actions on PBWorks workspaces.

Have fun!
